**Disclaimer:**

This project has been made to improve quality of life while solving real world problems. This does not support or encourage pirating activities.



## The problem

The last part of any supply chain is usually the least efficient. Statistically, it contributes to up to 28% of the total cost. That is a huge number and therein lies the problem, less efficiency. 

## A simple solution?

Local auto rikshaws or taxi services can be used to deliver the goods (in their free time) along with the usual delivery executives to nearby places and get paid for the same.

## About the project

The project revolves around a mobile application/webapp which is integrated with taxi companies or local auto rikshaws who think they aren't getting their worth. 

This app aims to improve their income without disturbing the current system and their schedule much. 

#### what the project aims to do:

* Integrate with a map so that the product can be delivered to the right location.

* Allow the taxi driver to choose the best delivery location for him contributing to fuel saving.

* Calculate quality of delivery.

* Measure number of deliveries.

* Provide security for the products to be delivered.
